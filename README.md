## Basic Informational Site
Very basic site made with Node/express.

## Description
Basic site made with Node/express that displays a few links that takes users to pages for about, contact, index, and a 404 error page. This was designed to be pretty much the most simple node/express site possible with just a few links to different pages.

## Why?
The point of this small project was to familiarize myself with basic node/express by making an extremely simple site that displays a few html pages with links to the other pages. It helped to learn the basics of node/express and understand the basics of making a simple http request and sending a simple response in express.
